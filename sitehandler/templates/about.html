    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
        We empower patients by allowing them to easily browse doctors based on their specific <strong>specializations</strong>. This ensures that you can connect with the right medical professional for your needs, streamlining the appointment booking process. For our doctors, the platform provides a comprehensive overview of their scheduled appointments, facilitating efficient patient management and the ability to create and store <strong>prescriptions</strong>.
